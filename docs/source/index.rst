.. deprecated:: 3.23.0.1
.. versionadded:: 3.22.15.0
.. versionchanged:: 3.22.16.2

.. math:: 50/(2 + 3x) * damage_multiplier

.. math:: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

.. math::

   (a + b)^2  &=  (a + b)(a + b) \\
              &=  a^2 + 2ab + b^2

.. math::
   :nowrap:

   \begin{eqnarray}
      y    & = & ax^2 + bx + c \\
      f(x) & = & x^2 + 2xy + y^2
